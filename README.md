## üîó Included Code Snippets

These are code snippets used in the **Nebula** project, designed to enhance and automate parts of WordPress configuration:

---

### üìò [OneAll Auto Config Setup](https://github.com/MightyX3N/Nebula/blob/main/OneAll%20Auto%20Config%20Setup/code_snippet.txt)

**Description**:  
This snippet automates the initial setup of the **OneAll Social Login** plugin in WordPress by injecting API credentials and default settings directly into the configuration file. The providers (currently set to **Discord**, **GitHub**, and **Steam**) are manually defined in the code snippet like so:

```php
if (!isset($current_settings['providers']) || !is_array($current_settings['providers'])) {
    $current_settings['providers'] = [
        'discord' => 1,
        'github'  => 1,
        'steam'   => 1,
    ];
    $changed = true;
}
```

Currently, these providers can only be set manually in the config file and will only apply when a new subsite is created ‚Äî they **cannot** be automatically updated once set.  
An ideal improvement would be to make these providers **selectable via a form**, so changes could be automatically applied across old and new subsites. This would make the code more flexible and easier to maintain.

### üìò [Bricks License Auto Config](https://github.com/MightyX3N/Nebula/blob/main/Bricks%20License%20Auto%20Config/code_snippet.txt)

**Description**:  
This snippet automatically sets the **Bricks Builder license key** in a WordPress installation. It's especially useful for theme development environments or staging setups where the license needs to be applied quickly and consistently via a form on the network admin dashboard.  
This removes the need for manual license entry, ensuring that all subsites are correctly licensed and ready for development.

### üìò [Discord Widget Auto Dark Mode](https://github.com/MightyX3N/Nebula/blob/main/Discord%20Widget%20Dark%20Mode/code_snippet.txt)

**Description**:  
This snippet automatically enables **dark mode** for the **Discord Widget** on your WordPress site by utilizing the **Dracula Dark Mode** plugin. It leverages the plugin‚Äôs functionality to switch the widget's theme to dark mode, ensuring a seamless visual experience for users in low-light conditions.

Please note that there may be a very tiny delay between the light and dark mode switching. This delay is due to the way the theme transition occurs but is generally imperceptible for most users.

The plugin used for this functionality is **[Dracula Dark Mode](https://wordpress.org/plugins/dracula-dark-mode/)**, which enhances your site with a dark theme option.

## 🔗 Included Code Snippets

These are code snippets used in the **Nebula** project, designed to enhance and automate parts of WordPress configuration:

---

### 📘 [OneAll Auto Config Setup](https://github.com/MightyX3N/Nebula/blob/main/OneAll%20Auto%20Config%20Setup/code_snippet.txt)

**Description**:  
This snippet automates the initial setup of the **OneAll Social Login** plugin in WordPress by injecting API credentials and default settings directly into the configuration file. The providers (currently set to **Discord**, **GitHub**, and **Steam**) are manually defined in the code snippet like so:

```php
if (!isset($current_settings['providers']) || !is_array($current_settings['providers'])) {
    $current_settings['providers'] = [
        'discord' => 1,
        'github'  => 1,
        'steam'   => 1,
    ];
    $changed = true;
}
```

Currently, these providers can only be set manually in the config file and will only apply when a new subsite is created — they **cannot** be automatically updated once set.  
An ideal improvement would be to make these providers **selectable via a form**, so changes could be automatically applied across old and new subsites. This would make the code more flexible and easier to maintain.

### 📘 [Bricks License Auto Config](https://github.com/MightyX3N/Nebula/blob/main/Bricks%20License%20Auto%20Config/code_snippet.txt)

**Description**:  
This snippet automatically sets the **Bricks Builder license key** in a WordPress installation. It's especially useful for theme development environments or staging setups where the license needs to be applied quickly and consistently via a form on the network admin dashboard.  
This removes the need for manual license entry, ensuring that all subsites are correctly licensed and ready for development.
